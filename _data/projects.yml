    gitbase, is a SQL database interface to Git repositories.

    It can be used to perform <mark>SQL</mark> queries about the Git history and
    about the [Universal <mark>AST</mark>](https://doc.bblf.sh/) of the code itself. gitbase is being built to work on top of any number of git repositories.

    gitbase implements the *MySQL* wire protocol, it can be accessed using any MySQL
    client or library from any language.

    [src-d/go-mysql-server](https://github.com/src-d/go-mysql-server) is the <mark>SQL engine</mark> implementation used by gitbase.

    I am contributor and maintainer of this awesome project. 
    I've implemented a lot of new functionality like the first version of the packfile writer with delta selection.
    I learned a lot with this project about low-level performance improvements and heavy profiling.

    *go-git* is a highly extensible git implementation library written in **pure Go**.

    It can be used to manipulate git repositories at low level *(plumbing)* or high level *(porcelain)*, through an idiomatic Go API.
    It also supports several types of storage, such as in-memory filesystems, or custom implementations.

    It's being actively developed since 2015 and is being used extensively by [source{d}](https://sourced.tech/) and [Keybase](https://keybase.io/blog/encrypted-git-for-everyone), and by many other libraries and tools.

    Working directly with a great SAP team on their offices, we created a SQL distribution layer based on Apache Spark for his new in-memory database called Velocity. 
    The project lately was renamed to SAP Hana Vora.

    We started this project as a POC to show to management. 
    After two weeks we had a working prototype able to create aggregations on top of Apache Spark Streaming with a small config file.
