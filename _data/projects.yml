    <mark>Torrent</mark> client with on-demand file downloading as a <mark>filesystem</mark>.

    Distribyted tries to make easier integrations with other applications among torrent files, presenting them as a standard filesystem.

    We aim to use some compressed file characteristics to avoid download it entirely, just the parts that we'll need.

    Also, if the file format is not supported, distribyted can stream and seek through the file if needed.

    <mark>SQL engine</mark> which parses standard SQL (based on MySQL syntax), resolves and optimizes queries. It provides simple interfaces to allow custom tabular data source implementations:

    - Generic extensible SQL engine that performs queries on your data sources.
    
    - Provide interfaces so you can implement your own custom data sources without providing any (except for the mem data source that is used for testing purposes).
    
    - Have a runnable server you can use on your specific implementation.
    
    - Parse and optimize queries while still allow specific implementations to add their own analysis steps and optimizations.

    - Provide some common index driver implementations so the user does not have to bring their own index implementation, and still be able to do so if they need to.

    Now heavily used and maintained by the awesome [Dolt team](https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server).

    *go-git* is a highly extensible <mark>git</mark> implementation library written in **pure Go**.

    It can be used to manipulate git repositories at low level *(plumbing)* or high level *(porcelain)*, through an idiomatic Go API.
    It also supports several types of storage, such as in-memory filesystems, or custom implementations.

    It's being actively developed since 2015 and is being used extensively by [source{d}](https://sourced.tech/) and [Keybase](https://keybase.io/blog/encrypted-git-for-everyone), and by many other libraries and tools.

    gitbase, is a SQL database interface to Git repositories.

    It can be used to perform <mark>SQL</mark> queries about the Git history and
    about the [Universal <mark>AST</mark>](https://doc.bblf.sh/) of the code itself. gitbase is being built to work on top of any number of git repositories.

    gitbase implements the *MySQL* wire protocol, it can be accessed using any MySQL
    client or library from any language.

    [src-d/go-mysql-server](https://github.com/src-d/go-mysql-server) is the <mark>SQL engine</mark> implementation used by gitbase.
